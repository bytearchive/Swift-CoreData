SwiftDo
=======

I wrote this very simple Core Data application to learn how Swift handles and integrates with some core concepts/tools:

- Singletons, even if they're [smelly](http://www.objc.io/issue-13/singletons.html)
- Core Data stack
- NSFetchedResultsController

One of the most important things that took me *forever* to figure out is that you have to namespace your model class in the ```.xcdatamodel```. This was undocumented. Huge thanks to [Andrew Ebling](https://twitter.com/andyeb/status/476376522400743424) for pointing me in the right direction.

If anyone has any tweaks or improvements, please send some pull requests. I'd love to see what you come up with.

As always, please feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_ryannystrom).
